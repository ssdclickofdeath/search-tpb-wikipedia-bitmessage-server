=====================

This is the server code that runs a Bitmessage service that allows others that send messages to it to search/get articles from Wikipedia, and search or retrieve a list of the top torrents from The Pirate Bay.

I am just hosting this code as a mirror; I don't know how it works, so please don't ask me.
